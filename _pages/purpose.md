# Purpose

We believe that the web is the most important invention by man, ever. It is at
once disruptive and revitalizing. Most importantly, it is our *home*. We grew up
alongside the internet, watching bubbles burst, new markets emerge, social
networking go from niche to natural, and civil liberties get called into
question.

As inhabitants of the web, we know that there is always a better way to do
something. If we aren't constantly evaluating ourselves and finding
opportunities for improving our workflows or processes, then we have stagnated
and should reevaluate our calling (or we have reached nirvana, and will be
leaving this plane shortly).

With these core tenents in mind, we want to:

1. Continuously improve
2. Feel fulfilled
3. Build quality products
4. Position ourselves for the future
